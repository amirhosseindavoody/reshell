# Proposed improvements

Ideas for hardening and extending reshell without turning it into a multiplexer.
These are proposals for review — not a committed roadmap. Prefer changes that stay
closer to `dtach` / `abduco` than to tmux/screen/Zellij.

**Out of scope (intentionally):** panes, tabs, status bars, and prefix key chords.
Those fight the product thesis (one PTY, minimal key interception, nested TUIs just work).

## Implementation hardening

### 1. Harden attach exclusivity — done

**Was:** Exclusivity is soft — an `attached` lock file plus a flag in `meta.json`.
A second client can race past a check-then-connect window (TOCTOU between the
client’s pre-check and the daemon accepting the socket).

**Now:** The daemon holds an exclusive advisory `flock` on `attached` for the
life of the connection. A second socket is closed immediately; `attach` refuses
when the flock is held. Leftover files without a flock holder are recovered as
stale.

### 2. Fold PTY `EAGAIN` into the poll loop — done

**Was:** `write_all_fd` to the PTY busy-waits on `EAGAIN` with a short sleep
instead of participating in the main `poll` loop.

**Now:** Client→PTY bytes go into a `pty_outbound` buffer; the daemon polls
`POLLOUT` on the PTY master and resumes partial writes without sleeping.

### 3. Safer auto-generated session names — done

**Was:** Auto names look like `session-{unix_secs}`, which can collide if two
sessions are created in the same second.

**Now:** Names are `session-{unix_secs}-{4 hex digits}` (from `/dev/urandom`),
with a retry if the directory already exists.

### 4. Daemon observability — done

**Was:** Failures may land in an ad-hoc `/tmp/reshell-daemon-error.log`. Attach
and kill paths have limited structured exit reasons.

**Now:** Per-session `daemon.log` under the session directory; optional `--log` /
`RESHELL_LOG` for fatal errors. Attach/kill errors name dead pid, lock held,
socket missing, etc.

### 5. Continuous integration — done

**Was:** No GitHub Actions (or similar) in-repo; quality depends on local /
pixi `cargo test` runs.

**Now:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `cargo test --locked` and `pixi run test`
on Linux.

### 6. Test DRY and race coverage — done

**Was:** Protocol encode/decode helpers are duplicated across integration tests.
Blind spots include concurrent attach, stale `attached` lock recovery, and `kill`
SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation. The full raw-TTY client path is not exercised in CI.

**Now:**

- Shared framing helpers in `tests/common/`.
- Cases for concurrent attach, stale-lock recovery, and kill escalation.
- Full client TTY path still needs a manual or external PTY driver; CI keeps
  talking the wire protocol to avoid flaky TTY tests.

## Small features (still on-brand)

### 7. Configurable detach key

**Today:** Only **Ctrl+\** (`0x1c`) detaches — intentional for nested TUI safety.

**Proposal:** Allow override via flag and/or env (dtach-style), with Ctrl+\ as the
default so existing muscle memory and TUI compatibility stay intact.

### 8. Human-readable `list` output

**Today:** `list` prints raw unix timestamps (“good enough for v1”).

**Proposal:** Show relative or formatted times by default. Optional `--json` (or
similar) for scripts that need stable machine-readable output.

### 9. `reshell info <name>`

**Proposal:** Print pid, shell path, socket path, attached/detached, created /
last-active times, and related paths. Useful when debugging “why won’t attach?”
without digging through the session directory by hand.

### 10. `reshell rename` and cleaner stale cleanup

**Proposal:** Rename a live session’s directory + meta without recreate/kill.
Continue improving stale-session cleanup (dead pid, leftover `attached` lock)
especially when people rely on auto-generated names.

---

## Bigger features (still not a multiplexer)

### 11. Optional scrollback / session log

**Today:** Explicit v1 non-goal — PTY output is discarded while detached; DEC
modes are still tracked so reattach can restore and force redraw.

**Proposal:** Optional ring buffer or append-only log while detached; either
replay a limited history on attach or dump to a file. Largest practical gap vs
tmux without adding panes or a status UI.

### 12. Broader VS Code / Cursor shell integration

**Today:** OSC 633 sticky-scroll handling plus bash/zsh inject when detectable;
other shells get passthrough only.

**Proposal:** Extend shell-integration inject for fish (and other shells where
VS Code/Cursor SI is well-defined), without breaking raw PTY passthrough.

### 13. `reshell ssh …` wrapper (post-v1)

**Today:** Explicit non-goal — no transparent SSH wrap.

**Proposal:** A thin wrapper that SSHes to a host and runs `reshell` remotely.
Matches what many people expect from this niche; keep it optional and explicit
so local session semantics stay clear.

## Suggested priority

| Priority | Items                        | Why                                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| First    | §§1–6 (hardening, CI, tests) | Correctness and maintainability without product drift |
| Next     | §§7–11 (CLI polish)          | Low surface area; matches dtach/abduco ergonomics     |
| Later    | §§12–15 (optional depth)     | Real capability gains; still avoid multiplexer chrome |

When implementing any item, update user-facing README and/or `design.md` /
`protocol.md` in the same change if behavior or interfaces change (see workspace
docs rule).
